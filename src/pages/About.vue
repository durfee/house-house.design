                p When filmmakers make movies, characters are portrayed by the actors who best embody the role. Similarly, House House staffs your project by selecting designers who will best fit the project requirements. The result is your team acquires the right number of folks handpicked for your specific situation.

                    p House House is organized a bit differently than the last agency you worked with, and we think that’s our biggest strength: tiny full-time staff, big network.

                    p Our full-time members call ourselves “residents:” we live and breathe the House House way. Sometimes the addition of a single resident on your team is all you need.

                p Some projects need a handful of specialists, like an information architect who has years of experience making sites for kids or a 3D animator who has extensive knowledge of the home improvement industry. Other projects call for an army of variously tenured folks, from junior-level production people to seasoned veterans who call the shots. For every project, we pull together the right people for the job.
