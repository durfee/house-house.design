        <p>They have values. And ethics. They’re busy; they don’t want you getting in their way.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph big-text">
        <p>We, too, have values. We’re stubborn that way. We won’t budge on what we believe in while pursuing: that’s exploring fresh approaches towards the intersection between seamless function, accessible technology, and comprehensive solutions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph big-text">
        <p>But we work differently than the last agency you hired; we design for the least privileged, and create results that scale. We’re not interested in adding to the noise; we’re here to make work that is accessible, intelligible, sophisticated. Work that will create transformative experiences for your audience — work that gets out of their way.</p>

      <div class="paragraph big-text">
        <p>House House is a multidisciplinary design practice in Vancouver, Canada — a joint production between Ben Groulx and Sean Durfee. You can hire us to help you connect with your audience in ways that will enrich their lives.</p>
