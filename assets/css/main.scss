// Styles
// ===
//
// Oh, hello. I didn’t see you there. Welcome to the beautiful, happy wonderland
// that is this stylesheet. Our CSS follows the following rules / philosophies:
//
//  1. Write CSS as if someone is using it to learn how code; it needs to be
//     sensible and learnable for our new front-end developers (and, eventually,
//     any other designers that joined our team), who would be making use of it
//     as well.
//  2. Aim for writing content-agnostic classes. In other words, content should
//     not be dictacting style. That’s why we
//  3. Write your HTML separately from your CSS; when these styles are turned
//     off, content should be formatted and arranged in a hierarchy that is
//     logical and semantic.


// Settings
// ---
//
// Code that does not output CSS styles directly. This includes CSS custom
// properties, custom media queries, etc. Things like brand colours, modular
// spacing increments, and breakpoints are defined as variables here.

@import 'settings/variables';
@import 'settings/extends';
@import 'settings/mixins';
// @import 'settings/syntax-highlighting';


// Base
// ---
//
// Styles that target bare HTML elements. This mostly consists of a mixture of
// normalize.css and reset.css, and core typographic styles for things like
// headings, body text, and links which will rarely, if ever, change. No classes
// are defined here.

@import 'base/general';
@import 'base/typography';


// Utilities
// ---
//
// The bread and butter of our CSS. These are single-purpose, highly-reusable
// classes that do one thing extremely well. We have utilities for things like
// margins, padding, text alignment, display properties, positioning properties,
// and more. Utility classes use a u- namespace, e.g. u-bg-black.

@import 'utilities/appearance';
@import 'utilities/background';
@import 'utilities/color';
@import 'utilities/display';
@import 'utilities/flex';
@import 'utilities/layout';
@import 'utilities/margin';
@import 'utilities/padding';
@import 'utilities/text';


// Components
// ---
//
// Content-specific classes that generate distinct UI appearances. This is
// largely limited to buttons and (lightly styled) custom form inputs. Component
// classes use a c- namespace, e.g. c-button.

@import 'components/container';
@import 'components/content';
@import 'components/heading';
@import 'components/hero';
@import 'components/logo';
@import 'components/overlay';


// Templates
// ---
//
// ⚠️ USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION: Sometimes, there are times that we need to write
// template overrides, or classes that are linked directly to the page on which
// they appear. These styles should be used as a last resort only!

@import 'templates/home';


// Third-Party Plugins
// ---
//
// Third-party integrations and plugins often do not let us control their
// settings, or require us to override how they work. Toss those styles into
// individual partials below.
//
// @import 'third-party/flickity';


// Temporary Styles
// ---
//
// Don’t add anything more here! These styles should be moved out eventually

@import 'archive';
